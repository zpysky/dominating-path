\begin{abstract}
Mobile sensing is usually limited in 3D space, as there are many inaccessible places where people rarely venture. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as drone, has greatly extends the scope of mobile sensing in 3D space, and pushed forward a variety of 3D mobile sensing applications, such as aerial photo- or video-graphy, 3D wireless signal survey, air quality monitoring. However, the limited battery life of drones has largely restricted the wide adoption of these applications; meanwhile, the flight between two locations consumes more of the drone's battery power than hovering over one location.
% http://forum.dji.com/thread-44164-1-1.html
To maximally expand the sensing scope of the drone, in this paper, we study the trajectory planning problem for optimizing its flight route in 3D space, given its limited battery life.
Specifically, we divide the target 3D space into a network of observation locations formed by multiple 2D grids, formulate the minimum dominating path problem in each 2D grid to find the optimal trajectory that has the maximal coverage in 3D space, and then select necessary critical observation locations along the trajectory for the drone to hover and perform the measurement.

\section{Introduction}~\label{sec:intro}




%1. 飞机应用很多，主要还是收集数据，飞到人类无法触及的区域或者角度。例如，拍照，采集wifi 信号，AQI 指数
%XXX intro: mobile sensing in space is limited: refers to the use of the sensors of a mobile device to acquire data from the environment, which
%XXX drone sensing in space starts to receive attention, AQI, wifi, etc.
Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as drone, is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard, which is commonly used in measurement and sampling in 3D space. Compared to manned aircraft, drones are more suitable for data collections and mobile sensing applications that capture different dimensions of signals in the environment that are beyond the sensing capability and scope of human beings, such as aerial photography~\cite{XXX}, 3D wireless signal survey~\cite{XXX}, air quality index (AQI) measurement~\cite{XXX, YangyuzheGlovecom}.

%2. 但是，飞机并未普及，很多公司还死掉了，为什么？
% 如果你真正用过玩过飞机，你就知道了（1）电池很短（2）大部分都很吵（3）无法负重因为会摇晃且电池更短
%XXX pain points: battery, noise, and hurt people
However, civilian drones are still not widely used by customers in our daily life today, due to lack of killer applications (e.g., the social network applications), and the privacy/safety concerns (no-drone zones are defined to protect the residents' privacy, or the safety of civil aviation system)~\cite{XXX}.
Moreover, if one has actually tried flying a drone, he/she may feel that existing civilian drones are not ready for use in daily life for its limitation in hardware.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Short batter life}: A drone's battery life is usually tens of minutes (less than half an hour)~\cite{XXX}, which limits the scope of the drone when mobile sensing in a large scale space.
  \item \emph{Annoying noise}: The noise made by the drone's propellers during flight prevents any application to be easily deployed in urban areas where people are living. For example, DJI drones generates noise over 70db~\cite{XXX}.
%  \item Wing rock and more battery drain caused by poor carrying capacity.
\end{itemize}

%XXX existing work emphasizes on points 1st, then routes
%XXX this work only focus on cases that prefers routes first, then points.
In this study, we are not interested in the battery technology, or noise cancellation.
Instead, we focus on how to maximize the scope that a drone can sense by following its trajectory. Since the drone can sense the signals in the cubic space around it, the sensing scope of a trajectory is the union of the cubic spaces that the drone has traversed along the trajectory. Therefore, the trajectory planning problem arises naturally: given the battery life and a 3D space, then \emph{how to plan the drone' optimal trajectory with a number of stops for maximizing its sensing scope?}

% 这个和 传统传感器网络中的，移动 base station 等工作类似，因为都是移动的，采集数据
% 但是，还是不同的，不同点包括：以前都是贪心的，我们这个问题不是
% existing selects stops first which is suboptimal, then connect then
% in drone, traj first, as traj is more important. this holds the promise of being optimized.


The conventional way of addressing the trajectory planning problem for a mobile device (e.g., a robot) takes a two-step approach: (1) first select an arbitrary number of stops first; and then (2) connect these stops to create a path. The first step is usually completed by a near-optimal solution to find a minimum vertex cover; and the second step can be done by a simple greedy algorithm to find the shortest path connecting those stops~\ref{XXX}.

However, such a stop-selection-first strategy does not work well for planning a drone's trajectory. If an arbitrary number of stops is chosen first, due to the limited battery life, the drone may not be able to complete the expected path and traverse all stops before running out of battery. Hence, it is necessary to first find a path for the drone, and then select an appropriate number of stops within the path based on its remaining battery life.

Moreover, the flight mode is usually dominant in a drone's trajectory, while the hovering mode (for collecting sufficient measurement data in mobile sensing) only takes a few seconds at each stop. Thirdly, it is known that the flight mode consumes more battery power than the hovering mode~\cite{XXX}, and our experimental results shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eva_time_battery} also confirm this when flying a DJI DJI Phantom 3 Quadcopter. These observations again motivate the design of a path-planning-first strategy for addressing the problem

% A drone has two modes, flight and hovering in a trajectory. The time consumed by a drone trajectory can be divided into flight time, and hovering time (or measurement time in mobile sensing applications). During most time of a drone's trajectory, it is in the flight mode, as the measurement at a stop only requires a few seconds for the drone.

In this paper, we study the optimal trajectory planning problem of a drone for 3D space mobile sensing applications. We extend the concept of dominating set in graph theory, define a new concept called the dominating path, and formulate the problem as the minimum dominating path coverage problem. By dividing the 3D space into a grid of observation locations (OLs), we propose an algorithm that first finds the minimum dominating path of the drone that maximizes the sensing scope, and then selects an appropriate number critical OLs within the path to perform measurement.

% get size of COL and OL-path in O(1)
According to the proposed algorithm, we are able to calculate the length of the trajectory and the number of critical OLs by $O(1)$ time; and to draw the trajectory and select critical OLs in $O(\mathbb{N})$ time where $\mathbb{N}$ is the total number OLs in the grid. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing greedy algorithms in two aspects: (1) the proposed algorithm takes less time to complete sensing in the same space, on average 20\% less time than other solutions; (2) within the battery life, the proposed algorithm can reach on average 15\% more sensing scope than other solutions. 

% ;  than  We use drones to verify our simulation. We find out that the flight time we use is less than ordinary approach.




%Specifically, we consider the following two special cases:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item \emph{Consider flight time only}: Under this condition, we assume measurement time negligible and consider flight time only. We choose the shortest OL-path in OL-network to minimize flight time and select all OLs in OL-path as COLs. Therefore, we could formulate problem as a minimum dominating path. In this paper, we solved this problem in grid which could extend to three-dimensional space.
%\item \emph{Consider total time consuming}: Under this condition, we consider total time consuming which is the sum of flight time and measurement time. Since flight time usually take up most of time consuming, we find the shortest OL-path first. Then in order to minimize measurement time, we select least OLs in OL-path to cover OL-network. Also, we solve this problem in grid.

\section{Related Work}~\label{sec:related}

\subsection{Drones in 3D mobile sensing}
Conventional mobile sensing systems rely on the mobile devices or ground-vehicles to perform the environmental sensing in a 2D plane, e.g., the mobile data analysis using bikes~\cite{eisenman2009bikenet} or cars~\cite{devarakonda2013real}.

%BikeNet: A mobile sensing system for cyclist experience mapping :
%BikeNet represents the first comprehensive mobile sensing system quantifying the cyclist experience and provides for the collection and analysis of personal performance and communal environmental sampling. BikeNet supports two modes of operation in support of delay-tolerant and real-time sensing, and collected data can be presented both locally to the cyclist or to others via back end services.
%
%Real-time Air Quality Monitoring Through Mobile Sensing in Metropolitan Areas:
%The first work that study the long-term stability, reliability and impact of realtime pollution monitoring systems using commodity sensors and the problems associated in deploying such systems.  Present a vehicular-based mobile approach for measuring fine-grained air quality in real-time.



Drones become more and more popular in 3D mobile sensing applications since they could capture different dimensions of signals in the 3D environment that are usually beyond our sensing capability.
Aerial photo or video-graphy applications~\cite{Newman2014Drone} facilitate the collection of images, and the analysis over the collected data. For example, it is feasible to locate anomalies in image data, and link particular image data to an address of the property where the anomaly is detected. DroneSense is a system for 3D wireless signal survey~\cite{Yu2016Automating}, i.e., measuring wireless signals in the 3D space, which provides us with an efficient method to quickly analyze wireless coverage and test their wireless propagation models. SensorFly is designed for indoor emergency response or inspections in inaccessible places where people cannot reach~\cite{Purohit2011SensorFly}, which forms aerial sensor network platform that can adapt to node and network disruptions in harsh environments.


However, these 3D mobile sensing applications of drones are constrained by the limited battery life, which motivates a more efficient measurement approach to better design the trajectory.



\subsection{Trajectory planning problem}
To address the trajectory planning problem, the genetic algorithm~\cite{Hu2006A,Yun2011Improved} and particle swarm optimization~\cite{Fu2012Phase} are always proposed for real-time path planning, which could find an optimal or near-optimal path for robotics in both complicated static and dynamic environments. These approaches have been applied on the UAV platform which could ensure partial minimality between two nodes.

Meanwhile, the trajectory planning for a large scale mobile sensing scenario is usually formulated as an ordinary Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) or a special TSP problem~\cite{Tekdas2009Using,Savla2005On}.
Existing solutions take a two-step approach: (1) the first step is to find a minimum vertex cover in the underlying network graph (i.e., a number of measurement locations that cover the given sensing area); and (2) the second step is to find the shortest path connecting these vertices (locations), along which the mobile device can traverse to complete the mobile sensing task in space.

% Some heuristic algorithms, like Life~Long~A*~\cite{Koenig2004Lifelong}, are developed to repeatedly searches for the shortest path from a given source vertex to a given destination vertex in the network graph where the cost over edges can be changing over time.

In this paper, we take a different approach by finding the optimal path first and then selecting the measurement locations, as the flight consumes more battery than hovering for drone operations.

% give a different approach that reverses order of path finding and locations selecting, and we will give an algorithm based on graph theory which could be optimal if considering flight time only.


\section{System Model and Problem Formulation}~\label{sec:problem}

% 例如，3d 空间怎么分，怎么定义一些变量
% 然后，problem formulation，得到一个problem，就是我们需要求解的目标
In this section, we establish a multi-layer 3D network model that are formed by multiple 2D networks for mobile sensing in the 3D space. In the first case when the flight time is dominant, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a minimum dominating path problem. In the second case, we consider both the flight time and hovering time of the drone, and formulate the problem as a combination of the minimum dominating path problem and the constrained minimum dominating set problem.

% We will make further discussion in next subsection. Finally, we define variables that would be used to mathematical proof next section.

\caption{The divided cuboids of a 3D space; a center OL in the cuboid in the green color; and the OLs and their cuboids in the coverage set of the center OL.}
\label{fig:cuboid}
\end{figure}

%XXX a figure
\textbf{Dividing the 3D space into cuboids}: We divide a 3D space into cuboids with $a$ meters long, $b$ meters wide and $h$ meters high. We define the center point of cuboid $i$ as its observation location (OL) (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cuboid}), which is denoted by the 3-tuple (longitude, latitude, and altitude), i.e.,
\[
OL_i=(x_i, y_i, z_i),
\]
where $x_i, y_i, z_i$ are 3D coordinates of OL~$i$. Note that we call the OL at the center of cuboid $i$ as OL~$i$.

\textbf{3D network of observation locations (OLs)}: OLs form a 3D network graph $\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V};\mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{V}$ denotes the set of vertices and $\mathcal{E}$ represents the edges connecting neighboring vertices. Specifically, the OL inside each cuboid~$i$ is considered as a vertex in $\mathcal{G}$, and an edge $(i,j)$ exists, if cuboid~$i$ is adjacent to cuboid $j$ (i.e., they are the same in two coordinates and adjacent to each other in the third dimension coordinate). As a result, the OLs forms a 3D grid in the space.


\textbf{The coverage set of OL~$i$}: We define the coverage set of OL~$i$ as the set of OLs including those located in the cuboids of the cuboid~$i$, plus OL~$i$ itself, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cuboid}.



\textbf{Critical OL (COL)}: Given limited battery life, it is impossible for a drone to traverse all OLs in the space. Hence, we need to select a number of critical observation locations (COL) from OLs where the drone can perform the measurement.


\textbf{Correlation between OLs}: We assume that the sensed data at two OLs in the same 3D space may have certain correlation. Intuitively, the more distant two OLs are located, the less correlation they may have. That is, two adjacent OLs have the strongest correlation in their sensed data; the sensed data at two adjacent OLs are almost the same if the distance between them is small. Hence, if the drone has sensed at one OL, it can skip sensing at its adjacent OLs.

\textbf{Multiple layers of 2D grids}: The 3D grid can be divided into multiple layers of 2D grids at different heights. If the drone has sensed at OLs in one layer of 2D grid, it can skip sensing at OLs in its adjacent layers of 2D grids (i.e, the one upper layer and the one lower layer). Let $G=L_{m,n}=(V;E)$ denote a 2D grid with $m$ rows and $n$ columns.


\subsection{Time consumed}
The time consumed by the 3D mobile sensing of drones consists of two parts: (1) the flight time, and (2) the measurement time.

Let $V_C \subseteq V$ denote the set of COLs, and $v_{C_i}$ is $i-th$ vertex in $V_C$. Let $V_P \subseteq V$ denote the set of vertices in the drone's trajectory which forms a path in $\mathcal{G}$. We have $V_C \subseteq V_P$ since the trajectory should contain the COLs, i.e., vertices in $V_C$.


\textbf{Flight time}: the flight time $T_F$ is time consumed by the drone's flight. In the formed 3D grid, we use Hamiltonian distance to characterize the distance between OLs. So teh flight time is proportion to the length of the trajectory, which is written as
$
T_F=t_F |V_P|,
$
where $t_F$ is the flight time for a unit length in the coordinate system of the 3D grid.

\textbf{Measurement time}: the measurement time $T_M$ is time consumed by the drone for hovering and measurement. For the same sensing task (e.g., WiFi signal survey), we could assume that measurement time is the same for all OLs. So the total measurement time is proportion to the number of COLs, which can be written as
$
T_M=t_M |V_C|,
$
where $t_M$ is the measurement time at each OL.

Therefore, the total time $T$ consumed by the drone is
\[
T=T_F + T_M.
\]

\subsection{Problem formulation}
% Given a 3D space, we first establish a 3D OL network $G=(V;E)$ which forms a 3D grid. Each OL in grid has a coverage set. Due to drones' limited battery life, we want to complete flight in the shortest time. Hence, in order to minimize total time consuming, we select COLs from OLs to cover OL-network while find a OL-path(trajectory) covers COLs. We formulate this problem as a constraint set coverage problem in 3D grid.

We formulate the following two problems based on two observations: (1) the flight mode consumes more battery per unit time than the hovering mode for a drone; (2) the flight time much more than the measurement time in the trajectory for most sensing applications.

\subsubsection{Case~1: Considering flight time only}
In this case, we assume the flight time is dominant, and the measurement time at each OL can be negligible. Then, we formulate the problem as a minimum dominating path problem in multi-layer 2D grids.
\begin{prob}[Trajectory planning by flight time only]\label{prob:flight-time-only}
Given a 3D grid $\mathcal{G}$ divided into multi-layer 2D grids, for each 2D grid $G=L_{m,n}=(V;E)$ where $V=\{v_0, v_1, ..., v_{|V|-1} \}$, assume the time required for completing a drone's trajectory is only relevant to the drone's flight time, and let $C(v_i)$ be the coverage set of vertex $v_i$ in $V$.


Since $V_C=V_P$, we seek to find the minimum dominating path $V_P \subseteq V$ which contains COLs in $V$ and covers all OLs in the 3D grid.
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \text{minimize}
& & \;|V_P| \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \bigcup_{v \in V_P} C(v)=V, ~~\;V_P \; is \;a \; path.
\end{aligned}
\]
\end{prob}


\subsubsection{Case~2: Considering both flight time and measurement time}
In this case, we assume the measurement time at each OL is not negligible. As the flight mode consumes more power per unit time, we first search for the shortest path that has the maximum coverage, and then select the least number of OLs along the path as COLs for measurement. We formulate this problem as a combination of a minimum dominating path problem and a constrained minimum dominating set problem in multi-layer 2D grids.

\begin{prob}[Trajectory planning by both flight time and measurement time]

Given a 3D grid $\mathcal{G}$ divided into multi-layer 2D grids, for each grid $G=L_{m,n}=(V;E)$ where $V=\{v_0, v_1, ..., v_{|V|-1} \}$, assume the time required for completing a drone's trajectory is dependent on the drone's flight time and measurement time, and let $C(v_i)$ be the coverage set of vertex $v_i$ in $V$.


We seek to find the minimum dominating path $V_P \subseteq V$ which covers all OLs in the 3D grid, and then select a set $V_C$ of COLs from $V_P$ as the dominating set.
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \text{minimize}
& & \;|V_P|,\;|V_C| \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \bigcup_{v \in V_P} C(v)=V,~~ \bigcup_{v \in V_C} C(v)=V,\\
&&& \;V_P \; is \;a \; path, ~~ \;V_C \subseteq V_P.
\end{aligned}
\]
\end{prob}

Therefore, we will discuss these two problems in the next section and give corresponding certifications.


\section{Construction of the minimum dominating path in 2D grids}
In this section, we first extend the well-known concept of the dominating set to define the dominating path in a graph.
Then, we address Problem~\ref{prob:flight-time-only} by proposing an optimal algorithm to find the the minimum dominating path in the 2D grid. We can concatenate the discovered paths (trajectories) in 2D grids to construct the one in the 3D grid.

\subsection{From the dominating set to dominating path}


% XXX add a figure to explain how to extend dominating path, and what are dominating path vertices

\textbf{Our definition of dominating path}: Recall that a dominating set for the graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset $D \subset V$ such that every vertex not in $D$ has a neighbor on $D$. A connected dominating set $D$ for graph $G=(V,E)$ is a special dominating set such that any vertex in $D$ can reach any other node in $D$ by a path that stays entirely within $D$.
Similarly, we have the following definition.
\begin{defn}~\label{lem:3extend}
A dominating path $L$ for graph $G=(V,E)$ is path $P \subset V$ such that every vertex not in $P$ has a neighbor on $P$ which is a special connected dominating set. In a dominating path $P$,
\begin{itemize}
  \item there exists a dominating set $D_P$ of $G$, and vertices in $D_P$ are called \emph{dominating vertices} of path $P$;
  \item and the other vertices in $P \setminus D_P$ are called \emph{connecting vertices} of path $P$.
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\textbf{Start from the trivial cases}: The goal is to find the minimum dominating path in a 2D grid $L_{m,n}$, where $m,n$ are positive integers.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Step~1: trivial cases}. When $m\leq 3$ and $n\leq 3$, it is easy to find the minimum dominating path;
  \item \emph{Step~2: adding more columns to trivial cases}. When $m\leq 3$ and $ 3< n \leq 6$, we seek to construct the minimum dominating path in the 2D grid  $L_{m,n}$ by extending the the minimum dominating path in the 2D grid  $L_{m,(n-3)}$ that has been found in Step~1;
  \item \emph{Step~3: adding more rows to trivial cases and transposing the grid}. When $3< m \leq 6$ and $ n\leq 3$, we first transpose the grid---swap the rows and columns of the grid, and construct the minimum dominating path in the 2D grid $L_{n,m}$ by following Step~2;
\end{itemize}
Any bigger-size grid $L_{m,n}$ when $3< m \leq 6$ and $3< n \leq 6$ can be expended by adding three more rows and/or three more columns from one of the grids in trivial cases. The The minimum dominating path in the bigger-size grid $L_{m,n}$ can be also found by repeating above Steps~2 and~3.

Next, we show the correlation between the smaller grid $L_{m,n}$ and the expanded grid $L_{m,(n+3)}$; note that the latter is expanded by adding three columns to the former.

\subsection{The size of the minimum dominating path in the expanded grid $L_{m,{n+3}}$}

\subsubsection{How many vertices are needed for constructing the minimum dominating path in $L_{m,n+3}$}
The grid $L_{m,n+3}$ can be divided into two parts: (1) the left part grid from the 1st to the $n$-th columns, and (2) the right part from the $(n+1)$-th to the $n+3$-th columns. The left part is basically a smaller grid of $L_{m,n}$.

Given the grid $L_{m,{n+3}}$, we will derive the minimum number of vertices needed to add into the minimum dominating path of left part grid (i.e., $L_{m,n}$), so as to construct the minimum dominating path in $L_{m,{n+3}}$.
% Since vertices in $L$ consists of dominating vertices and connecting vertices, we split dominating path in $L_{m,n+3}$ into 5 parts: $L=D^c_{1,n}(L) \cup D^c_{n+1,n+3}(L) \cup C^c_{1,n}(L) \cup C^c_{n+1,n+3}(L) \cup C^{ccon}_{n}(L)$.

\begin{lem}~\label{lem:ndominating}
Let $P^*$ denote minimum dominating path of $L_{m,n}$, and $P$ denote a minimum dominating path of $L_{m,(n+3)}$. Then there exists at least one minimum dominating path $P$ in $L_{m,(n+3)}$, such that the number of dominating vertices of path $P$ is no less than the number of dominating vertices of path $P^*$. That is, $|D(L)| \geq |D(L^*)|$.
% In other words, none of vertices in $G^c_{1,n}$ is covered by $D^c_{n+1,n+3}(L)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
We have $|D^c_{1,n}(L)| \geq |D(L_{m,n})|$ if all vertices in $G^c_{1,n}$ is dominated by $D^c_{1,n}(L)$ since $G^c_{1,n}=G^*$. Therefore, if $|D^c_{1,n}(L)|<|D(L^*)|$, some vertices in $G^c_n$ must be dominated by $D^c_{n+1}(L)$ and do not have neighbors in $D^c_{1,n}(L)$.

Consider there are $k$ continuous vertices $v_k$ in $G^c_n$ dominated by $D^c_{n+1}(L)$.

If $k \geq 2$, since these $k$ vertices are not dominated by $D^c_{1,n}(L)$, the corresponding $k$ vertices $v_{k'}$ which are in the same row with $v_k$ in $G^c_{n-1}$ can not belong to $D^c_{1,n}(L)$. Therefore, k vertices $v_{k''}$ in $G^c_{n-2}$ should belong to $D^c_{1,n}(L)$ to dominate $v_{k'}$ because only two endpoints in $v_{k'}$ could be dominated by its top and bottom vertex instead, but their right neighbors could not belong to $L$ which makes $L$ irregular. So we could use the corresponding vertices in $G^c_{n-2}$ to replace them so as to shorten $L$. Then, we could use $v_{k''}$ to construct. As shown in .

Since $L^c_{n+1,n+3}$ may have multiple connected components, $L$ may step into $G^c_{n+1,n+3}$ and then move out $G^c_{n+1,n+3}$ or just move to the end point.

In the first case, since $L$ may move out from $G^c_{n+1,n+3}$, we could construct as Fig and add connecting vertex to corresponding position.

In the second case, when $D^c_{n+1}$ come from $D^c_{n+2}$, we have the following three cases. When $|v_k|>3$, $L$ would need more vertices in $G^c_{n+3}$ to dominate vertices in $G^c_{n+2}$. And we could use similar construct like the first case. When $|v_k|<3$, $L$ will need more connecting vertices which could also use the same construct. When $|v_k|=3$ and vertex in $v_k$ do not reach $G^r_m$, then vertex below $v_{k'}$ must belong to $L$. So vertices in Fig is a dominating path for $L_{6,n+3}$ partial but can not reach the minimum so that $L$ could not be the minimum dominating path because the form of minimum dominating path for has same start pointing as $L$.

When $D^c_{n+1}$ do not come from $D^c_{n+2}$, $L$ would step into $G^c_{n+1,n+3}$ in the first row, move down to $v_{m-1, n+1}$ and use vertices in $G^c_{n+3}$ to dominate remain vertices. Since $v_{1, n+1} \in L$, $v_k$ starts from $G^r_3$. Therefore, we could use similar construct before in Fig to replace $L$ to another dominating path $L^*$ where $|L^*|=|L|$

If $k=1$, then the vertex must lay in boundary otherwise it will need extra connecting vertices between $G^r_{n+1}$ and $G^r_{n+2}$. Therefore, we assume $v_{1,n+1} \in L$. Then $v_{1,n}, v_{1,n-1} \notin L$ and one of $v_{1,n-2}$ and $v_{2,n-1}$ must belong to $L$ to dominate $v_{1,n-1}$. If $v_{1,n-2} \in L$, $L$ will turn to $G^r_{n-1}$ to dominate vertices in $G^r_n$ and it will bring more vertices than the following condition. If $v_{2,n-1} \in L$, we will have $L$ like Fig (like $L_{4,11}$). This case could only exist once. We transform $L_{m,n+3}$ symmetrical. Then, $|D^c_{1,n}(L)| \geq |D(L_{m,n})|$.

\end{proof}



Given $P$ as the minimum dominating path of the grid $L_{m,n+3}$, let $D^c_{n+1,n+3}(P)$ denote the set of dominating vertices of path $L$ from the $n+1$-th column to the $n+3$-th column of grid $L_{m,n+3}$; and let $C^{con}_n(L)$ denote the set of connecting vertices of path $P$ between the $n$-th column and the $n+1$-th column. Then, we have the following lemma.
\begin{lem}~\label{lem:3dominating}
The number of dominating vertices of path $P$ from the $n+1$-th column to the $n+3$-th column of grid $L_{m,n+3}$, plus the number of connecting vertices of path $P$ between the $n$-th column and the $n+1$-th column is no less than $m$. That is $|D^c_{n+1,n+3}(P)| + |C^{con}_n(P)| \geq m$. Further, if $3 \nmid m$, then $|D^c_{n+1,n+3}(P)| + |C^{con}_n(P)| \geq m+1$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Since $G^c_{n+1}$ might be dominated by $D^c_{1,n}(L)$, we consider the coverage problem of $G^c_{n+2,n+3}$ only.

Before formal proof, we will prove that expect for one single case, $G^c_{n+2,n+3}$ is dominated by rows. Specifically, every row in $G^c_{n+2,n+3}$ is dominated by one connected component in $L^c_{n+1,n+3}$.

If $G^r_i$ in $G^c_{n+2,n+3}$ is dominated by two connected components in $L^c_{n+2,n+3}$, then we assume $v_{i, n+2}$ is dominated by a component above and $v_{i, n+3}$ is dominated by the other component beneath.

Therefore, there are two different scenarios. Under the first scenery, $G^r_i$ is dominated by two end vertices like Fig which can be transformed by extending one vertex to dominate all vertices dominated by two components. Under the second scenery, $G^r_i$ is dominated by one end vertex and one intermediate vertex. This is the unique case that could not be replaced. But we could take them as one part since the union of two components follows the result.

Then, we prove the lemma by induction. Obviously, when $m=1$, $|D^c_{n+1,n+3}(L) \cup C^{ccon}_n(L)| \geq 2$, when $m=2$, $|D^c_{n+1,n+3}(L) \cup C^{ccon}_n(L)| \geq 3$ and when $m=3, |D^c_{n+1,n+3}(L) \cup C^{ccon}_n(L)| \geq 3$.

Now assume the result holds for $m=k$. When $m=k+1$, if there is only one connecting component in $L^c_{n+1,n+3}$, $|\gamma_c(G^c_{n+2,n+3})| \geq m$. Adding 1 connecting vertex in $G^c_{n+1}$, $|D^c_{n+1,n+3}(L) \cup C^{ccon}_n(L)| \geq m+1$. If there are multiple connecting components in $L^c_{n+1,n+3}$, we assume $G^c_{n+2,n+3}$ is dominated by rows. If $a$ rows and $b$ rows are dominated by two connected components $L_a$ and $L_b$ respectively. If $3 \mid m$, then at most two of $a$ and $b$ could be divided by 3 so that $|(D^c_{n+1,n+3}(L) \cup C^{ccon}_n(L)) \cap (L_a \cup L_b)| \geq a+b$. If $3 \nmid m$, then at most one of $a$ and $b$ could be divided by 3 so that $|(D^c_{n+1,n+3}(L) \cup C^{ccon}_n(L)) \cap (L_a \cup L_b)| \geq a+b+1$. Therefore, multiple connected components can finally reduce to one component which also holds the result.

\end{proof}


% Based on the results of Lemma~\ref{lem:ndominating} and Lemma~\ref{lem:3dominating}, we decompose a minimum dominating path in $L_{m,n+3}$ into two parts: (1) the left part from 1st column to the $n$-th column of $L_{m,n+3}$; and (2) the right part from $n+1$-th column to the $n+3$-th column of $L_{m,n+3}$.

Since the left part of $L_{m,n+3}$ is a grid $L_{m,n}$, the following theorem tells the relationship between the minimum dominating paths of $L_{m,n+3}$ and $L_{m,n}$.
\begin{thm}~\label{thm:3period}
The minimum dominating path of $L_{m,n+3}$ contains at least $m$ more vertices than that of $L_{m,n}$. That is $\gamma_l(L_{m,n+3}) \geq \gamma_l(L_{m,n})+m$. Further, when $3 \nmid m$, $\gamma_l(G) \geq \gamma_l(G^*)+m+1$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
In Lemma~\ref{lem:ndominating} and Lemma~\ref{lem:3dominating}, we know that there exist at least one minimum dominating path $L$ in $G=L_{m,n+3}$, $|D^c_{n+1,n+3}(L)| \cup |C^{ccon}_{n}(L)| \cup |D^c_{1,n}(L)|$ could fulfill additive part in result. Therefore, if the result is false, $|C^c_{1,n}(L)| \cup |C^c_{n+1,n+3}(L)|$ in $G$ must be less than $C(L^*)$ of a minimum dominating path $L^*$ in $G^*$.

\textbf{Connectivity on the boundary}:
Because connectivity depends on structure of $G^r_n$ and there are only two start vertices in $L$, we have structures in $G^r_n$ like Fig. We will consider different structures of $L$ in $G^r_n$.

If there are only one connecting vertex $v_{i,n}$ in connected component, we have following two cases. In the first case, like Fig , we have $v_{i-1, n+1}$, $v_{i-1, n+2}$, $v_{i+1, n+1}$, $v_{i+1, n+2}$, $v_{i, n+2} \in L$. In this case, although $v_{i-1, n+1}, v_{i+1, n+1} \in C^{ccon}_n$ which decreases $|C^c_{1,n}(L)| \cup |C^c_{n+1,n+3}(L)|$, but $|C^{ccon}_{n}(L) \cup D^c_{n+1,n+3}(L)|=5$ which still use 4 vertices addition to dominate 3 rows. In the second case, we have $v_{i-1, n+1}$, $v_{i-1, n+2}$, $v_{i-1, n+3}$, $v_{i+1, n+1}$, $v_{i+1, n+2}$, $v_{i+1, n+3}$, $v_{i, n+3} \in L$ where $|C^c_{1,n}(L)| \cup |C^c_{n+1,n+3}(L)|=|C(G^*)|$.

If there are two connecting vertices in connected component, when we consider them separately, result is the same as one connecting vertex. If we consider them together, the size of $L$ in $G^r_n$ must be 4 as shown in Fig . We assume two vertices are $v_{i,n}$ and $v_{i+1,n}$. Also, we have two cases. In the first case, we have $v_{i-1, n+1}$, $v_{i-1, n+2}$, $v_{i-1,n+3}$, $v_{i,n+3}$, $v_{i+1, n+3}$, $v_{i+2, n+1}$, $v_{i+2, n+2}$, $v_{i+2, n+3} \in L$, also $|C^c_{1,n}(L)| \cup |C^c_{n+1,n+3}(L)|=|C(L^*)|$. In the second case, $|C^c_{1,n}(L)| \cup |C^c_{n+1,n+3}(L)|$ decreases 2, $|C^{conn}_{n}|$ add 2 and $|D^c_{n+1,n+3}|$ add 4 which use only 4 vertices addition to dominate 4 rows. It is less than additive part in result. However, this kind of structure could exist when $n$ is small since to reach that structure, $G^r_{i-2}$ and $G^r_{i+3}$ must be dominated by other components and this destroy the 3 periodic structure which will add more vertices in dominating path. Specifically, if there are two 2-period extends, the dominated rows will decrease more than gain in the dominating vertices. And if there are two 3-period extends, it could be replaced by similar structure which move two start points to $G^r_{n+3}$. Therefore, there are only two possibilities that the structure could exist. In the first possibility, $m \equiv 2 \pmod 3$ and $m \geq 11$, as shown in Fig , we have the structure. Consider the structure in $L_{m',n'}$. We assume the structure first appear when $n'=b$. Since $|L^c_{n'-2,n'}|=m'$, minimum dominating path $L'$ in $n'=b-3$ must hold the same structure which drop $m'+1$ vertices in origin $L'$. And this structure will hold till $n' \leq 3$. Except for $n'=1$ which is out of range, $n'=2$ or $n'=3$ do not have the same structure which makes contradictions. In the second possibility, $m' \equiv 1 \pmod 3$. However, we could simplify this case, since when $n' \equiv 0 \pmod 3$ or $n' \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, we could change $m'$ and $n'$. Therefore, we consider $m' \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ and $n' \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ only. Then, we could simplify to $L_{m',n'}$ to $L_{m',1}$ with the same approach like the first possibility which is also out of range.

\textbf{Connectivity in the middle}:
In this case, we split $L^{*c}_{1,n}$ on middle and connect two connected components in $L^c_{n+1,n+3}$ and generate $L$. We assume the origin endpoints in $L^*$ lay in $G^{*c}_n$, otherwise we need more connecting vertices between $L^c_{1,n}$ and $L^c_{n+1,n+3}$. If $C^c_{1,n}(L)| \cup |C^c_{n+1,n+3}(L)$ could be less than $|C(G^*)|$, we consider $L^c_{1,3}$. In Lemma~\ref{lem:3extend}, $|L^c_{1,3}| \geq m$ and if $3 \nmid m$, $|L^c_{1,3}| \geq m+1$. Therefore, we could move connecting vertices from $C^c_{1,3}$ to $C^c_{4,n}$ if necessary without add more vertices since there are no start point in $G^{*r}_4$ and we could reduce the extend from minimum dominating path in $L_{m,n-3}$ to $L^*$. Then, we could construct a minimum dominating path $L^{**}$ from $L^c_{4,n+3}$ and $|L^{**}| < \gamma_l(G^*)$ and this makes contradiction.

Therefore, since $|C^c_{1,n}(L)| \cup |C^c_{n+1,n+3}(L)|$ is no less than $C(L^*)$, we could prove the result.

\subsubsection{Meta structs for constructing the minimum dominating path in $L_{m,n+3}$}



In Theorem~\ref{thm:3period}, we have proof the minimum number of vertices needed to add into the minimum dominating path in $L_{m,n}$ is $m$, which can be achieved in certain structures of the grid. In other structures, we need either $(m+1)$ or $(m+2)$ vertices to construct the minimum dominating path in $L_{m,n+3}$ from that in $L_{m,n}$.
We call these certain structures in grids as three types of \emph{meta struct}.

\textbf{Struct~1: $\gamma_l(L_{m,n+3})-\gamma_l(L_{m,n})=m$}. There are two cases for meta struct 1.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item When $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, we could select vertices (red ones in Figure~\ref{fig:meta_struct1_1}) in rows~$r_2$, $r_5$..., $r_m-1$ in columns in~$C_{n+1,n+3}$ into minimum dominating path, plus the vertices (blue ones in Figure~\ref{fig:meta_struct1_1}) shifted from column~$c_n$ to column~$c_{n+3}$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:meta_struct1_1}. This struct can be repeated in bigger-size grids.
  \item When $n=1$, when $m \equiv 3 \pmod 1$ we could construct as Figure~\ref{fig:meta_struct1_2} and when $m \equiv 3 \pmod 2$ we could construct as Figure~\ref{fig:meta_struct1_3}. Both cases could only exist once.
\end{enumerate}





\textbf{Struct~2: $\gamma_l(L_{m,n+3})-\gamma_l(L_{m,n})=m+1$}. There are five cases for meta struct 2.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item When $m \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, we could construct the minimum dominating path using similar struct as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:meta_struct2_1}, which can be also repeated in bigger-size grids.
  \item When $v_{1,n}$ belong to the minimum dominating path in $L_{m,n}$, we have the meta struct as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:meta_struct2_2}.
  \item When $c_n \setminus v_{1,n}$ belong to minimum dominating path in $L_{m,n}$, we have another meta struct as shown in  Figure~\ref{fig:meta_struct2_3}.
  \item When $n \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, we could rotate direction of minimum dominating path of $L_{m,n}$ and construct with meta struct~1. If the rotation only brings one extra vertex, we have the meta struct as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:meta_struct2_4}.
  \item When $n \equiv 2 \pmod 3$ and $n \geq 8$, we could use the meta struct as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:meta_struct2_5} to construct the minimum dominating path in $L_{m,n+3}$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Struct~3: $\gamma_l(L_{m,n+3})-\gamma_l(L_{m,n})=m+2$}.
There are many cases for meta struct 3, and we only show the most common case here.
When there are no vertices in column~$c_n$ that belong to the minimum dominating path $P^*$ in $L_{m,n}$, vertices in column~$c_{n-1}$ must belong to $P^*$. Then, we could construct the minimum dominating path $P$ in $L_{m,n+3}$ with the meta struct as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:meta_struct3}, by adding $(m+2)$ vertices (red ones in Figure~\ref{fig:meta_struct3}).

\end{figure}


\subsection{Optimal Trajectory Planning Algorithm}\label{sec:floating}
Based on the previous meta structs, we will elaborate the trajectory planning procedure in the following---i.e., construct the minimum dominating path $P$ in grid $L_{m,n}$: (1) $m<4$ and $m<n$; (2) $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ or $m \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 1 \pmod 3$; (3) $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 0 \pmod 3$ or $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 2 \pmod 3$ or $m \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 2 \pmod 3$; and (4) $m \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 1 \pmod 3$.

\caption{The minimum dominating path for $L_{1,n}$, $L_{2,n}$ and $L_{3,n}$ }
\label{fig:path_case_1}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Case~1}
In trivial cases when $m<4$ and $m<n$, since the connected dominating set is also dominating path, we have the same structure as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:path_1} of \cite{Hamburger2007Routing}.
Therefore, we have
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\gamma_p(L_{1,1})=\gamma_p(L_{1,2})=1$, and if $3 \leq n$, $\gamma_p(L_{1,n})=n-2$
  \item $\gamma_p(L_{2,2})=\gamma_p(L_{2,3})=2$, and if $4 \leq n$, $\gamma_p(L_{2,n})=n$
  \item $\gamma_p(L_{3,n})=n$
\end{enumerate}

\label{fig:path_case_2_2}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Case~2}
Since the minimum dominating path in $L{m,1}$ contains $m-2-\lceil \frac{m}{3} \rceil$ connecting vertices, when $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$ and $n \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, we could use the meta struct~1 to construct $L_{m,n}$, and we can construct the minimum dominating path as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:path2_1}. Therefore, when $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, we have $\gamma_p(L_{m,n})=3ab+3a-2$.

Similarly, when $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, we use meta struc~1 when $n=1$, then we use meta struct~2 as $n$ increases. We can construct the minimum dominating path as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:path2_2}.
Therefore, when $m \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, we have
\[
\begin{aligned}
&\gamma_p(L_{m,n})\\
&=\left\{
\begin{array}{rcl}
3ab+3a+3b       &      & {a \leq 2}\\
3ab+3a+3b-1       &      & {otherwise}\\
\end{array} \right.
\end{aligned}

\subsubsection{Case~3}
XXX~We use the reduction on the structure to construct the minimum dominating path of $L_{m,n}$ in this case.

When $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, if $m=6$, we could construct $L_{6,n}$ using meta struct~1. Assume the result holds for $m=k$, then we could get the minimum dominating path for $L_{k+3,k}$ from $L_{k,k+3}$, since none of meta struct~1 or meta struct~2 will fit in the structure, we could use meta struct~3 to get the minimum dominating path for $L_{k+3,k+3}$. Then, we could use meta struct~1 to get $L_{k+3,n}$ when $n \geq k+3$ as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:path3_1} which holds the structure for $k+3$. We could use the same approach to construct $P$, when $m \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 2 \pmod 3$ as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:path3_2}.

When $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, we have two structures (a) and (b) as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:path3_3} and for different $n$ we also have two structures shown in ~\ref{fig:path3_2}. Assume the result holds for $m=k$, and the critical point between structure (a) and structure (b) is $n=l$ when $m=k$. Specifically, when $n \leq l$, $L_{k,n}$ has structure (a) and otherwise, $L_{k,n}$ has structure (b). For $L_{k,n}$ with structure (a), we could construct $P$ XXX~from $L_{k+3, l}$. Since structure (a) could only use meta struct 3 or meta struct~2, we use meta struct~3 on XXX~$L_{k+3,l}$ until it satisfies the condition of meta struct~2. XXX~And we hold result for $m=k+1$.

Therefore, we have following results.

When $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, assume $m \leq n$, we have $\gamma_p(L_{m,n})=3ab+2a-2$.
When $m \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, assume $m \leq n$, we have
\[
\begin{aligned}
&\gamma_p(L_{m,n})\\
&=\left\{
\begin{array}{rcl}
3ab+4a+3b+1       &      & {a \leq 2}\\
3ab+4a+3b      &      & {otherwise}\\
\end{array} \right.
\end{aligned}
\].
When $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, we have
\[
\begin{aligned}
&\gamma_p(L_{m,n})\\
&=\left\{
\begin{array}{rcl}
min (3ab+4a-2, 3ab+3a+2b-1)       &      & {b \leq 2}\\
min (3ab+4a-2, 3ab+3a+2b-2)       &      & {otherwise}\\
\end{array} \right.
\end{aligned}
\].

\label{fig:path_case_4}
\end{minipage}%
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Case~4}
We could easily get the minimum dominating path of $L_{4,4}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:path4_1}. Therefore, we use two meta structs 2 to construct the minimum dominating path of $L_{4,7}$ and we use meta struct~2 to construct the minimum dominating path of $L_{7,7}$. Besides, we construct minimum dominating path of $L_{4,n}$ when $n \geq 10$ from $L_{1,n}$ with a meta struct 1. Finally, for $m \geq 7$, $n \geq 10$, we could only use meta struct 3 to construct the minimum dominating path of $L_{m,n}$ from $L_{m-3,n}$, which leads to the result in Figure~\ref{fig:path4_1}.

Therefore, when $m \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, we have
\[
\begin{aligned}
&\gamma_p(L_{m,n})\\
&=\left\{
\begin{array}{rcl}
3ab+3a+3b-3       &      & {a+b \leq 4}\\
3ab+2a+2b+1       &      & {otherwise}\\

\subsection{How to concatenate 2D trajectories to a 3D one}
In a real-world 3D space that might be irregular, we give an approach to concatenate 2D trajectories to a 3D trajectory.
\begin{itemize}
  \item First, we divide 3D space into cuboids and obtain a 3D irregular grid; and then we further divide the 3D grid into multiple layers of 2D irregular grids.
  \item Then, for each irregular 2D grid, we could divide it into a number of regular 2D grids. In each regular 2D grid, we can use the proposed algorithm to construct the minimum dominating path for each of them.
  \item Finally, we could simply concatenate the minimum dominating paths for those regular grids because their starting points always lie on the grid boundary, which produce a trajectory for the drone in the 3D space.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Select critical OLs from the minimum dominating path}\label{dominating_set_construct}
Since Problem~2 is a combination of a minimum dominating path problem and a constrained minimum dominating set problem, we could use the same method in subsection~\ref{sec:dominating_path_construct} to first construct minimum dominating path of four cases, and then select the least number of OLs within the path as critical OLs (stops for the drone to hover at). However, dominating vertices in the minimum dominating path is the minimum dominating set of path by definition. Therefore, we could simply select dominating vertices in minimum dominating path as COLs which are shown in black vertices of figures in~\ref{sec:dominating_path_construct}. We use the same cases in~\ref{sec:dominating_path_construct} and get $|V_C|$.

\subsubsection{Case~1}: From figure~\ref{fig:path_case_1}, we have
\begin{enumerate}
  \item when $m=1$, $|V_C|=\lfloor \frac{n+2}{3} \rfloor$.
  \item when $m=2$ or $m=3$, $|V_C|=\gamma_l(L_{m,n})$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Case~2}: From figure~\ref{fig:path_case_2_1}, when $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, we have $|V_C|=3ab+a$.

From figure~\ref{fig:path_case_2_2}, When $m \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, we have $|V_C|=3ab+a+3b+1$.

\subsubsection{Case~3}: From figure~\ref{fig:path_case_3_1}, when $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, we have $|V_C|=3ab$.

From figure~\ref{fig:path_case_3_2}, when $m \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, assume $m \leq n$, we have $|V_C|=3ab+2a+3b+2$.

From figure~\ref{fig:path_case_3_3}, when $m \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $n \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, we have
\[
\begin{aligned}
&|V_C|\\
&=\left\{

\].

\subsection{Experiment Setup}


\textbf{Prototype}:
The prototype consists of two parts: (1) a drone with an API that can configure its trajectory; and (2) a measurement sensor board or a smartphone is installed into a plastic box with vent-holes made by a laser engraving machine, which is attached at the bottom of the drone. The drone we use is a DJI Phantom 3 Quadcopter, as shown in Figure~\ref{XXX}. There is an intelligent flight mode that allows the customization of the trajectory by configuring a number of stop locations such that the drone will autonomously follow this trajectory to hover over each stop and complete the flight. The GPS sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and the motion sensors collectively determine the current observation location of the drone and guide the drone to the next stop in the trajectory. At each stop, the drone hover for a few seconds, $T_M$, to collect sufficient measurement data, before traversing to the next stop.


% We use drones to verify our results. Since we divide 3D space into OL-network by cuboids which forms a 3D grid partitioned by height, we only consider algorithms in 2D grid.

\textbf{Compared algorithms}: We compare the proposed algorithm with two other conventional algorithms. In the proposed algorithm, we choose the minimum dominating path in grids first, and then select COLs from path. In contrast, the conventional algorithms we considered will select COLs in grids first, and then choose a path to connect the selected COLs. The two conventional algorithms differ by the way of selecting COLs, as introduced below.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Row-wise COL selection}: We select the minimum dominating set in grids first, and select an OL at boundary as start point. Then, we use a row-first COL selection strategy to find a row by row, along the longer side of the grid.
  \item \emph{Greedy COL selection}: We select the minimum dominating set in grids first, and then select a COL at boundary as start point. Then, we follow the greedy algorithm that chooses the next vertex $v$ as the closest one that can lead to the maximum coverage, such as:
      %XXX what greedy
      \[
       \min\limits_{d(v,v')} \max\limits_{ |N[v]\setminus N[P]| } v,
      \]
      where $v' \in \mathcal{G}$ is the last vertex of path of $P \subset \mathcal{G}$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Performance metrics}: We use the following two metrics for evaluating the algorithm performance.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Time consumed}: The time consumed is defined as total time of flight and measurement of the drone to cover the space of the trajectory under a specific algorithm.
  \item \emph{Coverage space}: The coverage space is defined as the maximum coverage area in the 3D space during entire battery life, by following the trajectory under a specific algorithm. %  Since algorithm is affected by input width and length, We fix the width of grid.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Results}
We choose an open space in a university campus which has a size of 45~m in length, 35~m in width, and 10~m in height. It is divided into 3D grids formed by 5 by 5 by 5~m cuboids.
%We consider the 2D 9*7 grid in space.
Since the time consumed is the sum of flight time and measurement time, we consider the impact of different measurement times in experiments, which are set as 0, 1, 2, 5 seconds at each COL. Note that the case when the measurement time is 0 second is equivalent to the case when we consider the flight time only.

Figure~\ref{fig:comp1} show the time consumed under compared algorithms with different granularity of the measurement time. The sensing area is a 2D grid of size 9 by 7~m. We observe that our proposed algorithm consumes less time when the measurement time is small. The gap between our algorithm and the row-wise COL selection algorithm decreases as the measurement time increases. When the measurement time is 5 seconds at each COL, the total time consumed by the proposed and the row-wise COL selection algorithms are equal.

Figure~\ref{fig:comp2} show the coverage space in the 3D grid under compared algorithms with different granularity of the measurement time during the battery life.
We fix the width of the grid as 6~m, we observe that our proposed algorithm could cover more space than other algorithms in all cases, during the whole battery life. As the measurement time increases, the coverage area by any of three algorithms decreases, since the measurement time consumes part of the battery. Meanwhile, the difference in the coverage space among three algorithms decreases when the measurement time is set greater.

In a real-world application, drones might be used to delivery packages or other goods. Hence, we also evaluate the time consumed and the coverage space with different loads when we only consider the flight time. Results in Figure~\ref{fig:comp3} and~\ref{fig:comp4} show that as the load increases, the time consumed of three algorithms to complete the sensing task of a given grid increases; meanwhile, the coverage space of three algorithms during the battery life decreases. Note that the proposed algorithm performs the best in all scenarios under different loads on the drone.

\subsection{Results in different-size spaces}
In experiments, we only test the performance of compared algorithm in a give 3d space with the fixed size. Next, we can evaluate the algorithm performance in different-size spaces.

Figure~\ref{fig:timeconsume} show the flight time in spaces with different width and length. We observe that our algorithm consumes less time to complete the sensing task in each grid. When fixing the width (or length) of the grid, the gap among algorithms increases as the length (or width) increases.

Similarly, we observe in Figure~\ref{fig:battery}, our proposed algorithm has the maximum  coverage space during the battery life; When fixing the width (or length), our algorithm could cover more space than other compared algorithms.

% XXX~We also observe that, when fixing the width, as length increases, the ratio between our algorithm and the row-wise COL selection algorithm could converge to a periodic result.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclude}
%In this paper, we propose a systematic study on the population distribution projection over offline geographical regions by analyzing the geographical attributes of online social networks (OSNs). We propose the concept of geo-homophily in OSNs to establish the correlation between online message diffusion and the stability of geographical regions where a population distribution can be drawn. We formulate the population distribution problem from the perspective of Dirichlet process, and present prediction models to show the process that OSN users are distributed into regions, and infer the floating population across regions. By experiments over the large scale datasets, it is shown that the online message diffusions can help evaluate the stability of geographical regions, which further facilitates the determination of population distribution over fixed regions; the proposed prediction models have a high prediction accuracy in inferring the change of floating population across regions.
